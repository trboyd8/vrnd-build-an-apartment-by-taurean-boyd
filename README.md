## Thoughts on the project
This project was interesting because it was the first time we had to spend time thinking of a design for the environment.
Ultimately, I ended up with a design that was a blend of what was displayed during our lectures and what I have in my own apartment.
The hardest part was implementing lighting as there is a lot of information you need to understand in order to make the lighting look good.
